     <h1>TOP Manufacturing Companies in The State of Georgia and their pollutants...</h1>

        <h2>Shaw Industries Inc.</h2>
        <p id="SP">	    Shaw industries Inc. is a flooring company headquartered in Dalton, Georgia. They manufacture carpet, hardwood, tile & stone, as well as laminate and synthetic turf. In their 2017 sustainability report, Shaw Industries Inc. claimed to be on a path to sustainability by lowering their Emissions intensity by 32%. However, the pollutants released in the manufacturing process of flooring, are dangerous regardless of output quantity. More carpets are produced yearly in the United States than any country, and Shaw industries control a major share of said market. However, instead of making carpets with materials that allow for much easier recycling, Shaw Industries has continued to incinerate and burn a surprising amount of carpeting, which encourages the release of chemicals such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which creates dioxin when burnt. Dioxin is known to be a deadly carcinogen, and a case of heart attacks, strokes, asthma, and pulmonary diseases. Unfortunately, the health impacts of this pollution are mostly felt in low-income communities, and communities of color. Furthermore, there is no requirement for the public to be informed about the burning of carpets in cement kilns as they are not regulated. They even shut down a recycling plant owned by them in the state of Georgia which was responsible for recycling nylon 6 face fibers, and replaced it with a new plant which no longer recycles used materials into more viable useful fibers but rather according to www.no-burn.org “downcycles and proceeds to continue the burning of carpets to save energy.”
Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.
          	 
            Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. is an aerospace/aviation company headquartered in Savannah, Georgia that designs, develops, manufactures, markets, services, and supports the world’s most technologically-advanced business jet aircraft. According to their 2014 sustainability report, Gulfstream is committed to looking for ways to improve their environmental performance by improving their recycling efforts, however repeatedly Gulfstream has been found guilty of releasing Toluene into the environment.
